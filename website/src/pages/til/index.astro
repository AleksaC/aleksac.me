<Posts title="Today I Learned" posts={posts}>
  TIL stands for today I learned. Here I'll share small nuggets of knowledge as
  I collect them. Most of the stuff here is in the form of advice or reusable
  snippets and can be digested in a couple of minutes.

  As with blog, majority of the posts here are related to software development and
  tech in general. Unlike blog posts, many posts here present no new information but
  rather highlight a piece of information that may be less prominent in other sources
  (e.g. documentation of a project).
