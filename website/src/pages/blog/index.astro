<Posts title={"Blog"} posts={posts}>
  This blog is an attempt to reshape my notes and ideas into somtehing that can
  be helpful to others, as well as clear enough so that I can get useful
  feedback on it and maybe even good enough to get me some clout.
  <br />
  <br />
  Majority of the posts here are about software engineering. While I don't have a
  target audience most of the stuff should resonate with somewhat experienced software
  engineers.

  When it comes to post titles and descriptions I try to word them in a way that
  I think would maximize engagement while not meaningfully misrepresenting the content.
